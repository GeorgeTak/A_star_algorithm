# A* (star) algorithm

I have designed a maze (n x n dimensions) , which has :
- 2 Exits (marked with the letter E, spotted in pos (0,0) and (n-1,n-1))
- tolls (20% of the maze's blocks are tolls ,marked with the letter T)
- unreachable spots  (20% of the maze's blocks are unreachable , marked with the letter X)
- a maze 'runner' (marked with the letter R and he is placed in specific spots)

I used Manhattan distance for A* 's heuristic
